            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I attended a French international school where I found Classics as fascinating as Physics. However, the Humanities won me over.</p>
            <p>After completing a 2-year level study in comparative literature in Paris, I studied History and Archaeology. Next, I completed a Masters degree in International Journalism at Cardiff University and in Classics at UCL with a view to teaching Classics in secondary education.</p>
            <p>I started tutoring soon after graduating my undergraduate studies in 2014 and teaching in 2016. I found that one-to-one suited me better as it allows for a closer relationship and collaboration between the tutor and the student. </p>
            <p>Over the last five years I have coached to success many high-achieving students, wanting to secure a place at top independent schools such as Westminster and St. Pauls or excel in their GCSE and A-Level exams; International students from Hong Kong and Russia who had never studied Latin and French before attending their British or American school, as well as undergraduates at Cambridge and Ivy League universities.</p>
            <p>My teaching philosophy is to engage with the student on a personal level, use humour and constantly revise the acquired knowledge. In addition to this, I tend to go beyond the exam-driven syllabus by studying some aspects of the specification in depth. This approach ignites in my students a love for learning, and subsequently leads to greater academic success. </p>
            <p>Outside tutoring, I enjoy very much reading, films and volunteering at animal charities</p>
