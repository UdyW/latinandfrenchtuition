            <h2>Exam Preparation</h2>
            <p>My track record of preparing students for Common Entrance and Scholarship exams is excellent, with many students being offered places in the most competitive independent schools. A real point of pride is recently mentoring two of my tutees to win the most coveted scholarship; The Queen’s Scholarship in 2017 and 2015. Other students have been admitted entry to Eton, Saint Paul’s via Wimbledon, Oundle. CE 13+ and Scholarship exams. To achieve these results, my exam preparation strategies are bespoke, rigorous and detailed, all the while providing model answers and essays for oral and written exams in both French and Classical Civilisation. </p>
            <p>Here you will find a variety of past papers and worksheets for all up from CE” up to A-Level. My unique tips and exam techniques will make all the difference in my students achieving their highest marks and obtaining the best possible school places.</p>

            <h2>One-to-one tuition</h2>
            <p>In the first session, I spend the first 10 minutes building a rapport with the student. Next, I try to assess student strengths and areas in need of improvement. I then recommend a customised learning plan that addresses my students needs and targets as well as their weaknesses so that they achieve their full potential. </p>
            <p>The ultimate goal is to foster a learning environment where students build their confidence in their abilities and become self-motivated learners.</p>
